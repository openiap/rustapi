# OpenIAP Java Client

To build the project:
```bash
mvn clean package
```

To run the application:
```bash
# This will run the jar that includes all dependencies
java -jar target/openiap-java-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

Note: Make sure to use the `-jar-with-dependencies.jar` version of the jar file, as this contains all required dependencies. The regular jar file will not work correctly.
