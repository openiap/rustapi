## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover any security issues, please let us know by one of the following methods:

- **GitHub Private Security Advisories**  
  Submit a private advisory on this repository.
- **Email**  
  Send an email to **security@openiap.io**.

We aim to acknowledge all valid reports within **48 hours**.

## Supported Versions

We actively provide security fixes for the **two most recent major releases**.  
If you’re running an older version, please upgrade to continue receiving important updates.

## Security Updates

- **GitHub Security Advisories**  
  Subscribe to be notified of any published advisories.  
- **Dependabot & Automated Scans**  
  We use Dependabot and GitHub’s code-scanning tools to catch vulnerabilities early.  
- **Third-Party Review & Penetration Testing**  
  We engage with independent auditors—hired by organizations using our platform—to perform annual code reviews and active penetration tests.

## Disclosure & Bounty

- Public disclosure is encouraged once a fix is available.  
- We do **not** currently run a paid bug-bounty program.

Thank you for helping us keep the project secure!
